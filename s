During the security evaluation of the KIBT application, it was observed that the application is contacting external domains (1.com and 2.com) using the unencrypted HTTP protocol. This makes the communication susceptible to interception by attackers using network monitoring tools. This vulnerability was demonstrated through Burp Suite, which successfully captured the traffic in plaintext, indicating that the data is not encrypted. It is important to note that Wireshark was not functioning correctly in this context to display the encryption status. Despite this, the plaintext data capture confirmed that the application traffic was not being protected by HTTPS or any other encryption methods.
